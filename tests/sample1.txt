BIOGRAPHY

Dr. Christan Grant is an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma. He received his BS and MS degree in Computer Engineering with a Software emphasis and he also received a PhD in Computer Science in 2015. He received each degree from the Computer & Information Science & Engineering Department in the University of Florida College of Engineering. He investigates novel methods for answering difficult questions including everything from traditional relational databases to intelligent question answering systems. In particular, he is interested in solutions involving streaming data and real-time human interaction. At UF he was a member of the Database Research Center and Data Science Research Lab. He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship award in the area of "Database Information Retrieval and Web Search". He was also awarded the Florida Georgia LSAMP Bridge to Doctorate Fellowship and a diversity award from the College of Engineering. Dr. Grant has served as an external editor reviewer for ACM SIGMOD, ACM VLDB, ACM CIKM, and IEEE ICDE conferences. He has also served on the program committee of the Broadening Participation in Data Mining workshop. He holds several publications and patents from internships at IBM Almaden Research Center.
